# Password-Generator

## Description

Created a password generator to allow the user to create a random password based on critera selected. 

A series of prompts will be shown to the user to select a password that meets the conditions specified. 

Password must be between 8 and 128 characters and have at least one character type which includes a lowercase, uppercase,
numeric, or special character. 

If password length not met, a prompt will display instructing the user to try again. 

Once length is confirmed, other criteria will be shown and a final password will be created. 

Applied all the javascript skills learned this week to create functions that generate a password. 

Learned how to use if statements and for loops to create conditions that will stop the process or complete it and return a value, 

which in this case was a password.
